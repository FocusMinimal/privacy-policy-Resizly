Resizly - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 4, 2026

We take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when using our macOS application.

In short: We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.

1. Collected Information

Resizly does not collect any personal data from its users, such as names, email addresses, location information, or device IDs. There is no membership system, registration form, or tracking mechanism within the application.

2. Images and File Access

To perform its core functions (screenshot resizing and framing), the App only accesses image files that you explicitly select or drag and drop onto the application.

Local Processing: The images you select are processed entirely on your device (locally).

No Server Transfer: Your images are never uploaded to a server, transmitted over the internet, or shared with third parties.

Data Security: Processed images remain within Apple's secure "Sandbox" environment and are saved only to the folder you specify upon completion.

3. Internet Connection and Data Transfer

Resizly does not require an internet connection to operate. There is no code within the application that transmits data externally (such as Analytics, Ad SDKs, etc.).

4. Third-Party Services

Our application does not use any third-party analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.) or advertising providers.

5. Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. In the event of any changes, the updated policy will be published on this page. Since the App does not collect data, these changes will not affect the security of your personal data.
